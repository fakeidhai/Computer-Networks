1. Mesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually
connected to other nodes.
2. It does not need any central switch or hub to control the connectivity among the
nodes.
3. Mesh topology is categorized into two parts: Fully connected mesh topology:
In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other. Partially connected
mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other.
4. It is robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the specified computer
connected to this cable.
5. Mesh topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are difficult when
connectivity gets more.
6. Cabling cost is high as it requires bulk wiring.
