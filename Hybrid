hybrid :
1. A hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies to form a resulting
topology.
2. If star topology is connected with another star topology, then it remains a star
topology. If star topology is connected with different topology, then it becomes a
Hybrid topology.
3. It provides flexibility as it can be implemented in a different network environment.
