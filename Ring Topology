A ring topology is a network configuration where device connections create a circular data path. Each networked device is connected to two others, 
like points on a circle. 
Together, devices in a ring topology are referred to as a ring network.

In a ring network, packets of data travel from one device to the next until they reach their destination. 
Most ring topologies allow packets to travel only in one direction, called a unidirectional ring network. Others permit data to move in either direction, called bidirectional.

The major disadvantage of a ring topology is that if any individual connection in the ring is broken, the entire network is affected.

Ring topologies may be used in either LANs (local area networks) or WANs (wide area networks). Depending on the network card used in each computer of the ring topology,
a coaxial cable or an RJ-45 network cable is used to connect computers together.
