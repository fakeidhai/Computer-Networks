Star :
● Star topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected
to a single device known as a central device.
● Star topology requires more cable compared to other topologies.
Therefore, it is more robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect a
specific computer connected to this cable.
● If the central device is damaged, then the whole network fails.
● Star topology is very easy to install, manage and troubleshoot. It is
commonly used in office and home networks.
